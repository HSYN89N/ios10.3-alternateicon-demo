# Sinple Supporter

Sinple Supporter is a dummy app to demonstrate how iOS Alternate Icons work. [This feature](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiapplication/2806818-setalternateiconname) was introduced in iOS 10.3 beta1. You can see it in action:

You should notice that `You have changed the icon for "Sinple Fan"` is a system alert that you cannot avoid. Its purpose is to prevent us from changing the icon without the user knows it. 

## How it works

Everything about this feature is explained in this medium post: [iOS 10.3 Alternate Icons: what can you do and how it works ?](https://medium.com/@juli1quere/ios-10-3-alternate-icons-how-it-works-a628e06620b6#.uukwcdmiz).


## Demo
To run the demo: simply clone this repo and open `SinpleSupporter.xcodeproj` with Xcode 8.3 (and above).
